## Exercise 

Get used to using python as a calculator. Try computing all of the following:

(i) $10 \sqrt{(2(11.4+12.6))}$



(ii) $e^{0.5}$



(iii) the value of $y=(10+sin(x)+x^2+cosh(x^2+1))/(sinh(x)+x^3+3x^4+e^x)$ for $x=\pi$ and $x=0.2$



## Exercise

Write a function that takes as arguement $r$ for the radius of a circle and returns the diameter $r$ of the circle, as well as the circle's circumference $c$ and the area $a$. Try the function for $r=6$.



## Exercise

Write a for loop to sum up all natural numbers from $1$ to $1,000,000$.



## Exercise

Compute the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{10}(i+1)$.



## Exercise

The curve $f(x)=x^2+3x+\sqrt5$ intersects the curve $g(x)=-x^2-2x+1$ at two points. Find the coordinates of the intersections and the gradients of the tangents to each curve at those points.



## Exercise

The Taylor series for sinh(x) is given by,

$$sinh(x)=x+\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^7}{7!}+ ...$$

Write a function that finds an approximate solution for $sinh(x)$. Try your function for $x=4$ and compute the error between your approximate answer and numpy's `sinh()` function. Report how many terms you need in order to achieve an error 

$$\epsilon < 1e-4$$.



## Exercise 

Consider the functions $f(x)=x^2$, $g(x)=sin(x)$, and $h(x)=sinh(x+1)-e^{2x}$. Write lambda functions that represents each of these functions. Then write another function that takes as its arguements two functions and the value of $x$ and returns the composition of the functions (e.g., $f(g(x))=f\circ g(x)$). Use this to find:

(i) $g\circ f(5.0)$

(ii) $f \circ g(2)$

(iii) $h \circ(g\circ f)(2\pi)$
